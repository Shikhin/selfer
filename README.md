##Selfer

"21st century, 512-bytes, world domination."

Those're the sorts of keywords that lead to the creation of a project as 
enigmatic as Selfer. 

[Selfer](/Shikhin/Selfer/), a project written by hobbyist OS developer 
Shikhin Sethi, was inspired by DavidCooper's BwtSecOS. The goal is 
simple -- to serve as a 512-byte OS which can edit, both itself and 
other sectors, and save them back to disk, so as to act as a 
"development environment" (albeit very basic). Although Selfer met the 
said goal a long time ago, Shikhin continued development, with an aim at 
adding a module environment to take Selfer global.

##Delusion

Selfer lies on the boundary of delusion and reality. While the core 
project is a serious project, intended to help people new to both OS 
development and x86 opcode encoding, the additional environment has been 
written just for "the lulz."

I hope everyone with a sense of humor appreciates it, while those who 
lack it would probably appreciate it more when Selfer takes over the 
world...
